    <td>Scottish Folds come in multiple coat colors and patterns, from white, cream, chocolate and black to patterns known as chinchilla silver, shell cameo, cinnamon shaded and blue smoke.
</td>
    <td>The Scottish Fold is seemingly made entirely of curves! This rounded, medium sized cat is compact and solid, with a round head, large round eyes and most notably their ears are small and neatly folded forward covering the ear opening. The Scottish Fold has a sweet expression and a luxurious short, dense coat.</td>
    <td>Scottish Folds aren't particularly vocal cats, and they have sweet, tiny, soft voices that many owners enjoy. Scottish Fold cats sometimes enjoy flopping on their back while napping or relaxing — what some owners call a "Buddha Sit." They also sit on their hind legs, giving them an otter-like appearance.</td>
    <td>We recommend a premium, Australian-made product such as Advance Wet and Dry Kitten Food. Feeding regular wet food meals along with dry kibble is a simple way to increase your Scottish Fold's water intake to ensure adequate hydration and help support urinary tract health.</td>

<h2>Scottish fold cats are usually bred with either American shorthairs or British shorthairs. Since they're always bred with other breeds, not all kittens in their litters will have folded ears. Subsequently, Scottish fold cats remain rather rare.The typical lifespan of a Scottish Fold is about 15 years. Like many breeds, the Scottish Fold can be predisposed to some health problems. Degenerative joint disease can be an issue, especially in the tail which should be handled carefully if stiffness is noticed.No matter how long you leave your feline friend, the chances are that when you return home, they will want to sit in your lap for some quality cuddle time. These cats can be found with a short-coated or long-coated appearance—many people refer to the long-coated versions as Highland Folds.Scottish Folds tend to be affectionate cats who enjoy cuddling. However, they're not considered clingy and will happily curl up in their favorite heated bed, too. But if your typically cuddly Scottish Fold suddenly avoids being held, cuddled, or petted, it may be a sign of pain caused by osteochondrodysplasia.Scottish Folds possess an easy-going nature and are friendly with people and other household pets. Their calm disposition makes them suitable for loud home environments with children and dogs.The welfare impacts of Scottish Fold Osteochondrodysplasia can be severe in terms of pain and inability to perform natural behaviours, as these cats can be lame, walk with an abnormal gait, can be reluctant to engage in normal movements such as walking or jumping, and can even become completely crippledPurebred cats cost more, in general, due to their breed status and popularity. Some colors cost more than others as well, depending on rarity. The cost also varies depending on how many cats are available and how much each one sells for, but expect to spend between $1,000 and $3,000 on your Scottish Fold kitten.</h2>

   <h1>As you might have guessed, round-faced Scottish Folds—lovingly referred to as Foldies—originated in Scotland. Standing 8–10 inches tall and weighing up to 13 pounds, they’re stocky cats with lots of love to give.Sadly theres a disease known as “Scottish Fold disease,” osteochondrodysplasia causes abnormalities in joints and bone development, Moss says. It’s responsible for the cat’s cute, folded ears but affects cartilage throughout the body. This results in early onset arthritis, pain, and even behavioral changes caused by discomfort. All Scottish Fold cats are affected, although some may experience more discomfort than others, Moss says. </h1>
