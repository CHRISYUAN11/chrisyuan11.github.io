     <heading>Scottish Fold Characteristics</heading>

  <p>Scottish folds are known for their easygoing temperament and general sociability. They usually get along great with cat-friendly dogs and other cats and adapt well to multi-pet households. Children who are old enough to respect this cat and not handle it roughly will make fast friends with the Scottish fold, whose affectionate personality is both comforting and endearing to people of all ages.

  The Scottish fold doesn't need a lot of active engagement or strenuous exercise to be happy; it will thrive in a household where casual play is balanced with plenty of quiet cuddle time.

  Scottish fold kittens are not born with folded ears. The ears of the kittens that carry the gene begin folding somewhere around 21 days of age, starting with the outer edge of the ear near the base. The fold gene is an incomplete autosomal dominant gene that affects the development of cartilage and bone throughout the cat's body.

  A cat that has two copies of the gene is said to be homozygous. Cats that have two copies of the gene that produces folded ears can have severe health problems, including a skeletal disorder called osteochondrodysplasia that can cause crippling arthritis at a young age. Homozygous cats are not bred for obvious ethical reasons.

  Cats that have one copy of the gene are heterozygous. They should display the folded ear characteristic but be somewhat healthier. They may develop arthritis but usually at an older age. There is controversy about whether these cats have a good quality of life or suffer pain and disabilatiy</p>

     <heading>History of Scottish Fold</heading>
     <p>The first Scottish fold was a barn cat named Susie discovered on a farm in Perthshire, Scotland in 1961. She had a natural mutation for folded ears, which she passed on to half of her kittens. Neighboring farmer William Ross took an interest in the unique ears and bred one of Susie's kittens, Snooks, with a male tabby cat. This started the line of Scottish folds.1

     Many veterinarians oppose breeding Scottish folds because any cat with the folded ear gene has osteochondrodysplasia, which will affect the cat to some degree and may cause pain or debilitation. Debates are active in countries where breeding continues.2

     While the breed was registered with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in the United Kingdom, this was withdrawn in 1971 due to ethical concerns about the health of the cats. However, breeding continued in the United States and elsewhere. They are accepted by the American Cat Fanciers' Association (ACFA), Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), and The International Cat Association (TICA).

     Scottish Fold Care
     Scottish folds are fairly low-maintenance cats that prefer to spend time with their humans. They need the typical amount of play and exercise as other domestic cats.

     Exercise
     Scottish folds are moderately active. They like to be around their humans and play interactive toy games. Provide a cat tree for climbing and surveying the room—even Scottish folds want to get "above it all" once in a while.

     When petting or playing with a fold, handle their tails gently. These cats commonly have stiff tails that may be painful to bend or pull.

     Grooming
     Scottish folds have dense fur that needs weekly brushing to help prevent hairballs and mats. Trim your cat's nails every couple of weeks and provide a scratching post so they can appropriately scratch without harming your furniture. Maintain good dental hygiene by brushing your cat's teeth at least weekly.

     Pay attention to your Scottish fold's ears and check them weekly for any signs of irritation, mites, or infection. The fold of the ears can make these cats slightly more prone to ear infections due to decreased airflow.</p>

      <p>It’s truly amazing all of the tiny and surprising places that a kitten can get into – and it can really catch you off guard if you’ve never had a feline buddy before! To make sure your kitten’s exploration stays fun and doesn’t raise your blood pressure, do a thorough kitten proofing operation prior to their arrival. It’s crucial that you inspect your home from a cat’s-eye-view, move any hazardous substances or objects out of paw’s reach, and block off unsafe areas or nooks where you won’t be able to reach your new pal.</p>

      <heading>What Supplies Do Cat Owners Need?</heading>

      <P>Prior to bringing your cat home, make sure you’ve got all the supplies you need to give them the pampering they deserve. Settle on a brand of cat food and purchase enough to last at least a couple of weeks. You’ll also want to buy a sturdy scratching post and a cozy bed. This will help your new cat feel at-home and may also redirect them from scratching your favorite rugs and furniture (although you’ll likely want to cover any cherished objects until you have a good sense of their scratching habits). Cat toys are a must as well – particularly because playing with your cat is a terrific way to begin to form a bond. And establishing a solid litter box routine is also in both you and your cat’s best interest, so here’s how to set up, clean and introduce your cat to a litter box.</P>

      <heading>How to raise a kitten</heading>
      <p>Young kittens need significant care as they’re just beginning to learn the ropes of the world and are literally developing a little bit more every single day. This means lots of supervision, lots of playtime, and yes, frequent trips to the vet for checkups, shots and vaccinations within the first year of their purr-filled little lives. You may want to consider enrolling your new fuzzy friend in a cat wellness plan – Pets Best offers cat coverage options that’ll help you pay for routine kitten checkups as they grow up (and they grow up so fast!). If you’re thinking about fostering a kitten so that it can eventually be adopted by another family, there are some specific things you’ll want to consider before fostering.</p>
